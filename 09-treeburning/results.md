1 Why did you choose the board size for your finalized table?

I choose 100 as the finalized board size for three reasons. One, 100 is a common number and directly correlates to percentages making comparison to density easier. Two, 100 created a size in which the density that led to the maximum burn size was close to what it reaches as size increases but still far enough away to show the density isn't exactly 0.6. Finally, 100 is a small enough number to allow for numerous tests and therefore more accurate results.

2 Why did you choose the number of repetitions size for your finalized table?

I choose 5000 repetitions as it should create 

3 What did your testing show about changing the board size?

4 Knowing that there were differences based on boardsize, what was the relationship between the board size and the maximum burn time? How did you test this?

5 What density of trees yields the maximum burn time?
